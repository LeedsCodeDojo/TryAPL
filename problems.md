# Problems

This document contains a few of the problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

For bonus points, when you have got the solution working, see how few characters you can implement it in.

### [Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.


### [Problem 5: Smallest multiple](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5)

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible (divisible with no remainder) by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

### [Problem 6: Sum square difference](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6)

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

> 1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + ... + 10<sup>2</sup> = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
> (1 + 2 + ... + 10)<sup>2</sup> = 55<sup>2</sup> = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

###[Problem 7: 10001st prime](https://projecteuler.net/problem=7)

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10,001st prime number?

### [Problem 9: Special Pythagorean triplet](https://projecteuler.net/problem=9)

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

> a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>

For example,

> 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup> = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.

Find the product abc.
