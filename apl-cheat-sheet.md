APL Operator Cheat Sheet
========================

Some of the main operators you might need. In APL (as with many languages), operators can be Dyadic (working on two operands, e.g. 5-6) or Monadic (working on one, e.g. -5). As with the '-' example, the same operator is often used for monadic and diadic operations. 

### Maths

| Operator | Name | Description | Example | Type |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | ---- | 
| + | Add | Adds operands together | 1+2 = 3 | Dyadic | 
| - | Subtract | Subtracts one operand from another | 7-5 = 2 | Dyadic | 
| ⌈ | Maximum | Finds the highest value| 4⌈12 = 12 | Dyadic |
