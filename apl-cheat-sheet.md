APL Operator Cheat Sheet
========================

Some of the main operators you might need. In APL (as with many languages), operators can be Diadic (working on two operands, e.g. 5-6) or Monadic (working on one, e.g. -5). As with the '-' example, the same operator is often used for monadic and diadic operations.
