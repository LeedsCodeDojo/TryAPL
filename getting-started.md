Getting Started Exercises
=========================

You can use the standard operators as normal, e.g.

        5 - 2
    3

##### Ex 1.1 - Add two numbers together.

One difference between APL and other languages is that you use the standard maths operators, e,g, 'x' instead of '*' for multiplication.  This means expressions in APL are more similar to their mathematical descriptions - but it does mean you can't enter them with a conventiona keyboard..

##### Ex 1.2 - Multiply two numbers.

APL operators also work with arrays as standard.  With arrays of the same size, operators wrk on pairs of elements:

        5 6 7 - 1 2 3
    4 4 4

##### Ex 1.3: Find the results of adding 10+1, 20+2 and 30+3 in a single operation.

etc.
